					<p>Turn around time on Cerakote<sup>&trade;</sup> work is up to 2 weeks</p>
				</div>

				<p>This Cerakoting service is being offered in Greenville, SC and surrounding areas. We are also offering this nationwide through our mail-in knife Cerakoting service! If you need your knife refinished this is a great option.</p>

				<section>
					<h3 class="section-heading">Are you NIC certified?</h3>

					<p>No, we are not NIC certified, but all that training does is offer tips and tricks on the process itself; note that certified Cerakote<sup>&trade;</sup> applicators still follow the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CC8QFjAB&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cerakoteguncoatings.com%2Fresources%2Ffiles%2FCerakote-Training-Manual-Web.pdf&ei=ZYkcU5z3DYaPkAeF94CwCw&usg=AFQjCNG0NC6REdyf6gNENStuVwgCa1Sqrg&sig2=TGKAjiBBPRE3yIowi2Zu5A&bvm=bv.62578216,d.eW0">application manual</a>. The application is straight forward and prep is key. You can be an applicator and not have the proper set up of equipment or not give the proper immaculate care of not getting finger oil on the parts during the coating process. We take the utmost care in both the prep and painting of your knife. We have done the research and invested in the proper equipment (which costs a few thousand dollars) to complete the job in an excellent fashion &ndash; one that you should be well pleased with.</p>

					<h3 class="section-heading">So what is Cerakote<sup>&trade;</sup>?</h3>

					<p>Well, chances are if you are on this page you already know what it is as well as it&apos;s benefits. Please check out a few of the videos below for a detailed comparison between Cerakote<sup>&trade;</sup>, Gunkote, Durakote, etc.</p>

					<blockquote>
						<p>Cerakote<sup>&trade;</sup> is a ceramic based finish that can be applied to metals, plastics, polymers and wood. The unique formulation used for Cerakote<sup>&trade;</sup> ceramic coating enhances a number of physical performance properties including abrasion/wear resistance, corrosion resistance, chemical resistance, impact strength, and hardness. Each of these properties is rigorously tested to guarantee that Cerakote<sup>&trade;</sup> products remain at the foreforont of the ceramic coatings market. Cerakote<sup>&trade;</sup> ceramic coatings utilize state-of-the-art technology to out-perform any competitive coating in both laboratory settings and real world applications.</p>
						<p><small>NIC Industries</small></p>
					</blockquote>
				</section>

				<p>We have painstakingly researched the proper setup and procedure to ensure the absolute BEST Cerakote<sup>&trade;</sup> application to provide the longest lasting, most durable finish to your knife.</p>

				<p>Several things that you should always look into when seeking a company to put a finish on your knife are:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>Do they have the proper setup for the prep work? Not prepping the part correctly will cause premature wear and cosmetic blemishes – which in turn is basically wasting your money.
						<ul>
							<li>Is their air compressor using truly &ldquo;dry air&rdquo;? A compressor naturally has moisture in the air, and unless they are using some type of filter system, the paint will have moisture in it and will not be nearly as durable or even aesthetically pleasing as time goes on.</li>
							<li>Do they have a dedicated paint room? A dedicated paint room w/ proper ventilation will yield the best looking finish.</li>
							<li>Is their oven using some type of electronic temperature controller (such as a PID controller)? Just using a household oven won’t cut it since these have been shown to vary up to +/- 50 degrees! This may not yield as consistent of a finish as a PID controlled oven will.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Can you talk to the person who will actually be the one painting your knife? Some may not feel as if this is important, but if you are sending a &ldquo;several hundred dollar&rdquo; item to a company, you want to know that it will be taken care of and that attention to detail will be given to every part during the Cerakoting process.</li>
				</ol>

				<p>At Razor Edge Knives, we do not do cut corners. All of the above questions will be positively answered from us. We are properly equipped to finish your item. Our customer service is top notch as is our Cerakoting service. Give us a call! We would be more than happy to discuss the finer points of Cerakoting your knife. Call or email for a quote.</p>

					<h3 class="section-heading">Prices</h3>

					<p>We only offer Cerakoting Services for knives at this time. All Cerakoting is done w/ the H series Cerakote unless otherwise discussed.</p>

					<p>Keep in mind sharpening will need to be done after this process as the application will dull the edge somewhat. Please note that this is also an excellent time to have your <a href="http://www.bladeforums.com/forums/showthread.php/1257278-Insane-performance-boost-in-cutting-ability!">blade reground</a> so it cuts well again, or to have any other <a href="http://www.bladeforums.com/forums/showthread.php/1243155-Professional-Sharpening-Regrind-Cerakote-Service-(pic-heavy!!)?p=14229486#post14229486">blade/custom work</a> done prior to the coating.</p>
