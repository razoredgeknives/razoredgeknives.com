				<p>Razor Edge Knives LLC provides the upstate of South Carolina with a professional, local, blade sharpening service that will make your blades better than new! We sharpen knives such as Wusthof<sup>&trade;</sup>, Henckel<sup>&trade;</sup>, Calphalon<sup>&trade;</sup>, etc. in addition to offering a water-stone sharpening service by hand for knives such as Shuns<sup>&trade;</sup> and many other Japanese knives that cost in excess of $300/knife. We also offer a Custom knife sharpening service and frequently sharpen knives up to $1000-1500/knife.</p>

				<p>We do provide a quick turn-around time; most of the time you will have your knives or scissors back the next business day! We try to provide an efficient sharpening service with a quick turn around time to our customers because we know many people need their knives as soon as possible, especially if it’s their only set of kitchen knives!</p>

				<p>Many knife/scissor manufacturers offer a blade sharpening service for free if you pay shipping, but then you have to deal with the hassle of packing them up, shipping them off, paying for shipping, and being without your knives for a week or two. If you live in the upstate, you will not have to send your knives off but instead can have them professionally sharpened here! You will not be disappointed with the knife/scissor/blade sharpening service that we provide&hellip; <span class="underline">most of the time they are sharper than when they came from the factory</span>. Please give us a try!</p>

				<div>
					<h3 class="section-heading">Prices for Services</h3>

					<ul>
						<li><strong class="underline">Custom Knives</strong> &ndash; Start at $30 and goes up depending on options. This price includes an extra $20 fee for the extreme care given to your custom knife (taping off the blade, handling gingerly, symmetrical bevels, etc) unless you specify otherwise. Also, no power equipment will touch your Custom unless agreed upon. Custom sharpening (w/ no powered equipment) is limited to blades 4″ and under.</li>
						<li>
							<a href="http://www.bladeforums.com/forums/showthread.php/1257278-Insane-performance-boost-in-cutting-ability!"><strong class="underline">Knife Regrinds</strong></a> &ndash; start at $50 and go up. This is for a basic 60 grit finish. Wharncliffs, Tantos, blade conversions, or higher grit finishing adds additional to price. This is custom priced per knife, however, general prices are: $50 for blades up to 5″, $60 for blades 5″-8″, and $70 for blades 8″-12″. I don’t really regrind any blades over this length unless worked out prior. Upgrades over base price:
							<ul>
								<li>220 grit satin finish: Add $25</li>
								<li>600 grit premium satin finish: Add $60</li>
								<li>Tanto regrinds: Add $10</li>
								<li>Zero grinds (taken up to 220 grit finish): Add $30</li>
								<li>Grind conversions (hollow to flat, flat to convex, conventional to tanto, etc): Add $5-15 depending on how complicated</li>
								<li>Blade sterilization/logo delete on flats (satin finished/hand rubbed): Add $40. If you want logos deleted on grind then you will have to do this in conjunction w/ a regrind.</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><strong class="underline">Plain-edged, single-bladed knives</strong> &ndash; $6/knife regardless of size. Tanto blade add $1. These are done on a slow speed, water cooled belt sander and many of my customers fit in this category.</li>
						<li><strong class="underline">Hand Sharpening of knives</strong> (i.e. Done on the Wicked Edge Precision Sharpener) starts at $11 and goes up depending on the desired options. Mirrored edges are done at my discretion and cost between $35 and $50 and will be able to whittle a hair on most knives. All knives over 4″ in blade length must be reprofiled on the belt sander first prior to finishing on the Wicked Edge. If any reprofile work is done on blades over 4″ blade length an additional $2-3 may be charged for the extra time/work. If 4″ or under then I can either match the angle for the listed price or reprofile by hand for an extra fee (specify if you want this done in the mail in form). Default method will be to set edge angle at 15 dps by belt sander and then micro bevel on the Wicked Edge at about 15 dps as this is a very durable edge yet will cut really well.</li>
						<li><strong class="underline">Double-edged knives/daggers</strong> &ndash; cost double whatever type blade/options you have (i.e. straight edge, serrated, etc). Please note these will be sharpened on machine only – no Wicked Edge sharpening option available unless done in conjunction w/ a regrind.</li>
						<li><strong class="underline">Japanese Sushi Knives</strong> &ndash; $15/ea (done on diamond or waterstones), more if repair needed. Secondary bevel will be applied.</li>
						<li><strong class="underline">Multi-bladed, pocket knives</strong> &ndash; $4/blade</li>
						<li><strong class="underline">Serrated knives &lt; 6″ blade length</strong> &ndash; $8/blade. (including full or partially serrated).</li>
						<li><strong class="underline">Serrated knives &gt; 6″ blade length</strong> &ndash; $11/blade. This will mainly apply to kitchen bread knives. Note: we also offer a Christmas Tree shearing knife sharpening service (which are serrated blades) and this costs in the range of $1-2/inch depending on how damaged they are.</li>
						<li><strong class="underline">Straight Razors</strong> &ndash; $30/blade (note: please do not send in poor quality razors as they will not be honed), these are honed to the sub-micron level for a superior shave! Any damage (rust, nicks, etc) that needs to be repaired will be $10 extra &ndash; this is verified and checked under microscopic examination of your edge and continued throughout the honing progression for the finest edge and shaving experience!</li>
						<li><strong class="underline">Machetes</strong> &ndash; $10/blade.</li>
						<li><strong class="underline">Swords</strong> &ndash; $1/inch sharpened unless complete reprofiling is needed, then it could be $2/inch.</li>
						<li><strong class="underline">Hatchet</strong> &ndash; $8/blade unless extremely damaged, if so call for a quote.</li>
						<li><strong class="underline">Axe</strong> &ndash; $12, Double-edged Axe – $20</li>
						<li><strong class="underline">Scissors</strong> (for general household/industrial use) &ndash; $8 ea (depending on condition of the scissors bulk discounts apply in quantities of >20 scissors (see the “Specials” above). Note: we can do industrial scissor sharpening in practically any quantity). </li>
						<li><strong class="underline">Surgical Shears &amp; Surgical Scissors</strong> (typically for veterinary purposes) &ndash; $8/ each </li>
						<li><strong class="underline">Lawn Mower Blades</strong> &ndash; $10/blade. You remove and bring to us.We will sharpen and balance the blade. </li>
						<li><strong class="underline">Garden tools</strong> &ndash; Call for a price</li>
						<li><strong class="underline">Chisels</strong> &ndash; $5/chisel and this will have 220 grit working edge</li>
					</ul>

					</ul>
				</div>

				<div>
					<h3 class="section-heading">Additional Fees</h3>

					<ul>
						<li><strong>Regrind/thinning</strong> &ndash; this is the single most important thing you can have done to your knife other than sharpening itself &ndash; it vastly increases cutting performance and makes the &ldquo;shoulders&rdquo; of the edge much thinner. This service is $40/knife for regular knives.</li>
						<li><strong>Tanto blades</strong> (sharpening) &ndash; add $1/blade (these have two separate edges that are time consuming to sharpen).</li>
						<li>We can also removed chipped blade tips for an additional fee of $2-4 (depending on how bad it is).</li>
						<li><strong>To grind down the return</strong> (on a kitchen knife) the cost is $3/knife.
						<li><strong>If you want me to put a &ldquo;back bevel&rdquo; or a &ldquo;double bevel&rdquo; edge on your knife, then I will do that for a custom quoted price (typically $3).
						<li><strong>Completely Wasted Serrations</strong> &ndash; add $3/blade for half serrated edges, add $8/blade for fully serrated edges. Add this per knife in addition to regular serrated knife fee. This is only if part or all of your serrated blade is wasted so bad that the edge that’s supposed to be sharp is actually mostly flat when looking at it straight on (in other words, it’s basically ruined). We will re-grind and hone where the serrations were supposed to be, and make it better than new!
						<li><strong>Reprofile Edges</strong> &ndash; Typically $2-5 per knife for machine sharpening.
