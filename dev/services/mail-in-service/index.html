				<h1>Mail-In Service</h1>

				<h4>How does the mail order sharpening work?</h4>

				<p>PACK &ndash; Pack up your knives securely in a cardboard box (smallest possible to save on shipping). The knives should be wrapped securely in newspaper with a rubber band or tape around them. Make sure you have several layers of newspaper around them, and that the tip is protected and won&apos;t poke through the box! If you have a sheath we highly recommend to use it for the shipping process. Also, don&apos;t forget to put extra newspaper or other cushioning material in the additional space inside the box to prevent your knives from bouncing around.<br />
				Make sure to include your name either in or on the box. If we discussed doing something special to your knife, please either include a note or specify the specifics in step 2 below..</p>

				<p>COMPLETE <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1w7Bb1MYWYSqGu_lxsZtSMXlS8kvkdAEo968p4TKuvh0/viewform?usp=send_form#start=invite">THIS FORM</a> so we know to be expecting your knives! Please only fill out this form if you are absolutely sure you will be sending something in so as to prevent confusion.<br />
				SHIP &ndash;  Get them to us! You pay shipping both ways to ensure that you get the fairest price possible and pay the ACTUAL shipping costs&hellip; nothing extra, no handling fees. We also HIGHLY suggest getting insurance as we will not be held liable for items that are damaged or lost in the mail either in the sending or return (**see below). Upon us receiving your blades, we will then sharpen them and send them back out while notifying you with a tracking #! You don&apos;t have to include a return label in the package as we will just add this to your invoice total when you pay.<br />
				** Please scroll to the bottom of the page for IMPORTANT information regarding shipping/insurance before you ship your item!!!</p>

				<p>R.E.K., LLC<br />
				591 Kay Dr.<br />
				Easley, SC 29640</p>

				<p>PAY &ndash;  We will then send you an invoice which you can pay with your credit/debit card online through Paypal. You can also pay over the phone. You do not have to have a Paypal account for this process to work, all you have to do is punch your card into the Paypal site. Note: other payment methods are available but may take longer (i.e. money order, check, etc) &ndash; contact us with questions.<br />
				ENJOY &ndash; Your knives will be returned to you via the shipping service that you used (**see below) getting your package to us, and you can enjoy the efficiency and smoothness of a razor sharp, better-than-factory edge on your blades! You won&apos;t believe the difference until you try it!</p>

				<p>* Our &ldquo;No-Risk&rdquo; Guarantee * If not completely satisfied with your edge, we will completely refund money paid to us!</p>

				// Highlight both this info below and the narrative where this is referenced above in yellow.


				<p>** IMPORTANT information (Company policy on care and shipping of knives): by shipping your knives/package to us you automatically agree to the following:</p>

				<p>Razor Edge Knives LLC (&ldquo;We&rdquo;) is/are only responsible for items shipped to us while in our care. We guarantee to take care of the items and that they will get back to the shipping company.<br />
				We are not responsible for lost or damaged items in the mail. It is the customer&apos;s responsibility to make sure to pick a shipping company they trust and to get insurance on the package.<br />
				We ship packages back to you using the shipping company and amount of insurance you choose in our &ldquo;mail-in form&rdquo; above (i.e. step 2 above) You assume all risk in shipping items to us.<br />
				If you used USPS to ship your item and got their insurance, we will alternately get Stamps.com insurance for the return trip.</p>
